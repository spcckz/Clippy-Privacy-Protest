# Clippy Privacy Protest

**Quickly opt out of top data brokers to reclaim your privacy and protest mass data collection. Safe & open source: this script does **not collect or send any data** — it only opens opt-out links in your browser.**

📎 **Inspired by Louis Rossmann's Clippy Movement**

This script helps you reclaim control over your personal information by quickly opening the opt-out pages of the majority of top data brokers. It's a **non-technical form of protest** against surveillance capitalism and mass data collection.

## Why This Matters

Big tech companies like **Google, Apple, and Facebook** collect and sell personal information as a major source of revenue. By opting out of data brokers and reducing your digital footprint, you can:

- **Protect your privacy** and reduce your personal attack surface  
- **Send a signal to companies** that users care about consent and data protection  
- **Participate in collective action** that pressures corporations and regulators  

Even small actions, when taken by many, can make a tangible difference.

## Starve the Data Beasts

Take additional steps to minimize tracking and ad revenue:

1. **Search Engines:** Use [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com), Whoogle, or SearXNG instead of Google.  
2. **Browsers:** Avoid Chrome; use **Firefox** with uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and ClearURLs, or **Brave**.  
3. **Video:** Watch content through [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks/) or [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) instead of YouTube.  
4. **Maps:** Use **Organic Maps** or **OsmAnd** for offline GPS and routing without tracking.  
5. **Regular Opt-Outs:** Repeat sweeps from data brokers every few months.  
6. **Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms (UOOM / GPC):** Enable **Global Privacy Control** in your browser to signal that you do not want your data sold or tracked.

> Every opt-out weakens datasets, reduces ad revenue, and sends a clear signal to big tech that users value privacy.

## Reporting Difficult-to-Find Opt-Out Pages

If a data broker or website makes it hard to locate opt-out options:

1. **Contact the company directly** via support or privacy team.  
2. **File a complaint with regulatory bodies**:  
   - US: [Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)  
   - EU: Local Data Protection Authority (DPA)  
   - Canada: [Office of the Privacy Commissioner](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/)  
3. **Raise awareness:** Share experiences on social media or privacy forums to encourage transparency.
