# Clippy-Privacy-Protest
Clippy Privacy Protest Script opens opt-out pages for top data brokers in one click. Protect your privacy, regain control over your personal info, and fight back against mass data collection. Every opt-out weakens surveillance capitalism and sends a collective signal to big tech: we won’t be tracked for profit.


# Clippy Privacy Protest Script

📎 **Inspired by Louis Rossmann's Clippy Movement**  

This script helps you reclaim control over your personal information by quickly opening the opt-out pages of the majority of top data brokers. It's designed as a **non-technical form of protest** against surveillance capitalism and mass data collection.

## Why This Matters

Big tech companies like **Google, Apple, and Facebook** collect and sell personal information as a major source of revenue. By opting out of data brokers and reducing your digital footprint, you can:

- **Protect your privacy** and reduce your personal attack surface  
- **Send a signal to companies** that users care about consent and data protection  
- **Participate in collective action** that pressures corporations and regulators  

Even small actions, when taken by many, can make a tangible difference.

## How It Works

1. **Run the script** (double-click the batch file or run the PowerShell version with execution policy bypass).  
2. **Select which data brokers** you want to open opt-out pages for.  
3. The script will **open your browser** to the relevant pages.  
4. **Follow on-screen instructions** to opt out manually if necessary.  

> ⚠️ Some sites like **Acxiom** or **Lotame** may show a 403 error. This is normal — you may need to visit those pages manually.

## Starve the Data Beasts

After using the script, you can take additional steps to minimize data collection and ad revenue:

1. **Search Engines**: Use [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com), Whoogle, or SearXNG instead of Google.  
2. **Browsers**: Avoid Chrome; use **Firefox** with uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and ClearURLs, or **Brave**.  
3. **Video**: Watch content through [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks/) or [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) instead of YouTube.  
4. **Maps**: Use **Organic Maps** or **OsmAnd** for offline GPS and routing without tracking.  
5. **Regular Opt-Outs**: Repeat opt-out sweeps from data brokers every few months.  
6. **Universal Opt-Out Mechanisms (UOOM / GPC)**: Enable **Global Privacy Control** in your browser to signal that you do not want your data sold or tracked.

> Every user who opts out weakens the dataset and reduces ad revenue. Corporations do notice shifts in user behavior — Apple’s privacy push is one example.

## Reporting Difficult-to-Find Opt-Out Pages

If a data broker or website makes it hard to find their opt-out page:

1. **Contact the company directly** via support or privacy team.  
2. **File a complaint with regulatory bodies**:  
   - US: [Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)  
   - EU: Local Data Protection Authority (DPA)  
   - Canada: [Office of the Privacy Commissioner](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/)  
3. **Raise awareness**: Share your experience on social media or privacy forums to encourage transparency.

3. **Optional**: Run the PowerShell version (`Clippy Privacy Protest.ps1`) with execution policy bypass.
